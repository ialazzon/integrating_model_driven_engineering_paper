# Repository for Paper Integrating Model-Driven Engineering

This is the GitHub repository containing the source code and artifacts related to the paper “**Integrating Model-Driven Engineering and Large Language Models for Role-Based Access Control Test Scenario Generation for Smart Contracts**” by Issam Al-Azzoni, Saqib Iqbal, Taymour Al Shkar, and Zobia Erum.

There are two folders:

1. _code_: Contains two Python scripts: one script to generate natural language descriptions for _sclang_ models, and a second script to convert an LLM’s JSON-formatted test case output to _sclang._
2. _case studies_: Contains all experimental artifacts related to the _Financial Transaction Approval (FTA)_ case study discussed in the paper as well as another extra case study not discussed in the paper called _Project Proposal Review_. Under each folder, we have included the model’s _.sclang_ file, the test cases (also in _sclang_ format), the test case table as an image file, and the full DAML code for the smart contract and test cases.
